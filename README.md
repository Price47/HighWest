HighWest
========

##Setup
with HighWest as the root directory:
 
- install the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- initialize database

Initialized db is included in the repo (schemas setup, 
test data from example file included), but to start fresh you can delete the 
`db.sqlite3` binary file, and run the django migrations (you'll also want to create a new
superuser to check the data being ingested):

```
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

##Running the app

Once everything is initialized, you can run it locally with
```
python manage.py runserver
```

which will start the app on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

You can check the data ingested from the upload in the admin page,
 `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`. You can log in with the credentials 
 already in the db binary (username `price` password `coolradguy`), or
 with the crednetials generated by running `python manage.py createsuperuser`
